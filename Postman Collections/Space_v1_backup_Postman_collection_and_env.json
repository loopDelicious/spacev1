    "description": "Super Cool Space Collection\n===\n\nThis is a sample collection and environment for the tutorial outlined in [Not your Grandma's Postman](http://blog.getpostman.com/2017/05/27/not-your-grandmas-postman/).\n\nRetrieve the **Astronomy Pic of the Day from NASA**, get an Imgur auth token, and then post the picture to **Imgur**.\n\n[![beautiful space pic](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1705/M101p2000bagi.jpg)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1705/M101p2000bagi.jpg)\n\nIf you haven't already, click the Run in Postman button to get the collection and environment into your Postman app. In the Postman app, you should now see this collection in the sidebar to the left, and this environment selected in the dropdown in the top right.\n\n[![download Space collection](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/importSpace1.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/importSpace1.png)\n\nTo get started:\n===\n1. **Register an Imgur app:** \n\n  Head to Imgur and [register a new application](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient). Select OAuth 2 authorization with a callback URL, and add the following Authorization callback URL - `https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback`.\n  \n  Make a note of your Imgur app's `Client ID` and `Client secret`. \n  \n  [![imgur client id](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurClientSecret_censored.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurClientSecret_censored.jpg) \n\n2. **Add your Imgur credentials to Postman:**\n\n  In the Postman app, head to the **Quick Look** icon in the top right to view your variables. Click the **Edit** link.\n  \n  [![quick look icon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurQuickLook.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurQuickLook.png)\n  \n  Update the `imgurClientId` and `imgurClientSecret` values with your own, and hit **Update**.\n\n  [![update environment variable](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurEnv.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurEnv.png) \n\n3. **Get an auth token from Imgur:** \n  \n  We will use [Imgur's OAuth 2.0 process](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth) to get a refresh token. \n\n  In the Postman app, under a new request, click on the **Authorization** tab, select OAuth 2.0, click on the **Get New Access Token** button, and fill in these values:\n    - Token Name: can be anything\n    - Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n    - Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n    - Client ID: {{imgurClientId}}\n    - Client Secret: {{imgurClientSecret}}\n    - Grant Type: Authorization Code\n    - Request access token locally: checked\n  \n  [![Postman OAuth 2.0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png) \n\n  Click on **Request Token** to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow authorizing the Postman app to connect to your Imgur account.\n  \n  [![Imgur Oauth](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png) \n  \n  Once that is completed, add the `refresh_token` value to your environment under the `imgurRefreshToken` key, the same way you added your Imgur credentials to Postman in Step 2.\n   \n  [![Imgur refresh token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg) \n\n4. **Run the collection:** \n\n  Click on the right angle bracket (**>**) next to the collection to open the collection details flyout, and click the blue **Run** button.\n\n  [![collection details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurRunSpaceCollection.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurRunSpaceCollection.png)\n\n  This will open the collection runner in a separate window. Verify that the correct collection and environment is selected in the respective dropdowns, and then click the **Start Run** button.\n\n  [![collection runner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/collection_runner2.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/collection_runner2.png)\n\n  In the collection runner, watch your tests running (and hopefully passing). If all goes well, your picture has been posted privately to Imgur under your account.\n  \n  [![collection runner gif](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/collectionRunner2.gif)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/collectionRunner2.gif)",

Review [documentation](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod) for the NASA API.\n\nStart in the Postman request builder. \n\n  - Method: Select `GET` from the dropdown menu of HTTP methods.\n\n  - URL: Enter the URL endpoint provided by NASA - `https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod`\n\n  - Parameters: This request will work without any additional parameters, and default to using NASA's demo key. However, we can choose to add query string parameters to our request. Click the Params button to reveal a key-value editor. As you input parameters, they are automatically added to the query string in the URL bar above.\n\nUnder the Postman **Tests** tab, we can write scripts in JavaScript to execute any logic after the request is sent. \n\nPostman tests are a good way to ensure that you're getting the correct, anticipated responses from your requests. You can include custom scripts to execute additional logic too.\n\n[![tests tab](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/APODtests.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/APODtests.png)\n\n- Under the Postman **Tests** tab, the first test ensures a successful 200 response status code.  \n- The second test will parse the JSON response object, and set environment variables (title, URL, etc.) that can be accessed in subsequent requests when the entire collection is run.\n- The third bit of code controls the workflow sequence and designates which request in the same collection to run next, instead of the next request in the list.\n\nRead more about [writing tests](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/test_scripts) and [controlling the workflow](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/building_workflows) in the Postman docs.  \n"

We could add the access_token value to our environment under a new `imgurAccessToken` key, the same way we previously added our Imgur credentials to Postman, but we'd have to come back in a month and update our key.\n\nInstead, let's automate the authorization process to make sure we always have a valid token. \n\nFirst, we will use [Imgur's OAuth 2.0 process](https://apidocs.imgur.com/#authorization-and-oauth) to get a refresh token. \n\nIn the Postman app, under a new request (separate from this example collection), click on the **Authorization** tab, select OAuth 2.0, click on the **Get New Access Token** button, and fill in these values:\n    - Token Name: can be anything\n    - Auth URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/authorize`\n    - Access Token URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n    - Client ID: {{imgurClientId}}\n    - Client Secret: {{imgurClientSecret}}\n    - Grant Type: Authorization Code\n    - Request access token locally: checked\n  \n[![Postman OAuth 2.0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAccessTokenModal.png) \n\nClick on **Request Token** to initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow authorizing the Postman app to connect to your Imgur account.\n\n[![Imgur Oauth](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurOauth.png) \n  \nOnce that is completed, add the `refresh_token` value to your environment under the `imgurRefreshToken` key, the same way you added your Imgur credentials to Postman in Step 2.\n   \n[![Imgur refresh token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/refreshTokenOauth.jpg) \n  \nNow, we can submit a request using our `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token`.\n\n  - Method: `POST`\n\n  - URL: `https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/token`\n\n  - Body: Under the **Body** tab of our second request, add the required parameter values using double curly braces to access our environment variables.\n\n[![Imgur Authorization Request Body](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurAuthBody.png) \n\nUnder the **Tests** tab, we can write scripts in JavaScript to execute any logic after the request is sent. Looking closer at the Imgur response object, we can parse the JSON object to retrieve and store our data, like a new access token.\n\n[![Imgur Get Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurGetAccessToken_censored.jpg) \n\nLet's set our environment variable based on the response from this request using Postmans `setEnvironmentVariable()` method and pass in our key and value. \n\n[![Imgur Set Access Token](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static-getpostman-com/postman-docs/imgurSetAccessToken.png) \n\nCreating an environment variable allows us to access this stored value in subsequent requests when the entire collection is run with our environment.\n\nRead more about [OAuth 2.0 authentication](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization#oauth-20) and [environment variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables) in the Postman docs.\n  "
